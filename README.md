Keep in mind this is a “living document” and nothing here is representative of the final product, at least at this point.

# **Concept Statement**

Sylentlands is a retro-style horror game with life sim elements. The player takes the role of a playtester during the early days of open-world video games, commissioned to play "some local kid's" game. Players will interact with the in-universe game’s creator, encounter earthly, environmental, and unusual entities and cryptids centered around New Jersey folklore all while managing their life outside of the game, and facing a threat bigger than the game itself…

# **Genre**

TBD

# **Target Audience**

People who like R. E. P. O’s artstyle and mesh of silly and creepy as well as survival games may enjoy Sylentlands. 

# **Concept Expansion**

Gameplay is sectioned off into “days”. Days are not timed, and are only ended when the player has no more branching, non-repetitive options and must end the day. Day 0 is the only full day you have of the “real world” phase, which involves performing downtime tasks such as communicating and browsing online, cooking, napping, decorating, buying pets, etc. You may have a list of tasks each day to prompt you to do certain things. Once you as the player receive the game from its creator, Day 1’s pre-game begins as you wake up in the real world the next day.  
At the end of each in-game play session, you are given a survey to which there are no desirable answers. Some may have an impact on the real world you’ve customized and/or the virtual world you have been employed to break.
